# Cardiovascular-Risk
Before diving into the project, lets discuss what are Cardiovascular diseases and some of their major causes.

Cardiovascular diseases, also called CVDs, are the leading cause of death globally, causing an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year.

CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol.

The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity.

# Objective
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) based on their health statistics and information about their tobacco usage.
